# Teaching Demos

This repository contains a collection of **interactive demos** created for my **teaching sessions and workshops** on game development and interactive media.  
Each demo illustrates a specific technical or creative concept â€” from 2D gameplay logic to 3D animation and interactivity.

---
## Purpose
These demos serve as **teaching materials** for introducing:
- Game engines and interactive frameworks (Phaser, Three.js)
- 2D and 3D animation principles
- User input and event handling
- Basic physics and lighting
- Scene organization and code structure for beginners

## Current Projects

###  Phaser Platformer Demo
> A small **Phaser 3** project showcasing a playable character, collectibles, traps, and a basic victory/defeat system.  
> Includes physics, collisions, and simple enemy AI.

### Three.js Workshop Demo
> A **Three.js** scene featuring dynamic lighting and shadows, a GLTF-animated character, and simple interactions:  
> - Click the door to open/close it  
> - Use arrow keys to switch between character animations  
> - Watch the sun and clouds move with smooth GSAP animations
